# Masters_Thesis_Funtional_Implentation
Lambert Brink's Master Thesis Code implementation

This library has the entire code for all the implementations of the methodology used during the master's thesis.
This includes the functional coding for the Arduino IDE and the coding for the Appscript to implement  the
Google sheet data. The thesis applied the general information as viewed below:

Code Style
The coding style within this thesis was functional, which is why the best method was not always implemented as extra outputs were required. Also time was minimal and getting the correct output
was more important.
